# Usivity

Usivity Social Support Portal was a project that [myself](https://modethirteen.com) and [Damien Howley](https://www.linkedin.com/in/damienh/) took on in 2012. Our goal was to normalize social and web traffic that was associated with a brand, and help that organization's agents manage comms - like identifing problems or support issues before they were officially raised as support tickets.

This repository was archived and opensourced in 2020 to provide a historical view into our thought-process and a state of product development at the time.
